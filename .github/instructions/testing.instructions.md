# Testing & TDD Instructions

1. **Write the test first**:
   - Frontend: use Vitest.
   - Backend: use xUnit or MsTest (based on project).
   - Name tests clearly: `shouldDoSomethingWhenCondition()`.
2. **Generate code with Copilot** based on the test.
3. **Run tests** and iterate until all pass.

This ensures reliability and confidence when adding new features.
